# VRCursorAttackExperiment
1. V0.7 notes
- Click a button: use your *right* controller to point at a button on the canvas and press the trigger button to click the button. 
- Button layouts: **Origin** is where you move your cursor to activate an attack (you should see a ball spawned and destroyed after you successfully activate the attack). **Bait** is where the user wants to click after clicking the **Origin** button. **Attack** (or attack target) is the button that the malicious developer wants to steal the clicks for. **Adjust** is where the user moves their cursor after their cursor reaches the **Attack** button in order for the displayed cursor to smooth back to the real cursor (however, you can simply move around randomly to reach the same effect).

- Note: the buttons above may vary depending on your VR system and your SteamVR input settings.
